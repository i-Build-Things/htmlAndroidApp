# htmlAndroidApp
This repository contains the code and .apk files required to make an android app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

Most HTML --> android app tutorials require Adobe PhoneGap Build which is unfortunately not available any more. To convert your files into an apk file for an app, you can use https://volt.build/

Creating a similar app would require you to follow the file structre of the myApp folder. If you would like to install the sample aplication, you can do so on any android device. Bear in mind that .apk files can be filled with malware so you may need to enable some settings. Unfortunately, apple doesn't allow users to isntall .apk apps on their phones, but you can try using an emulator. 

Creating your first android app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is not ideal as there are several features an app shoudl utiliise, like access to all the sensors which is limited in an app like this. However, if you have any simple problem you want to solve, then this is a great option. It is also great to see your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knoowldege come together like this. 

Apart from a text editor, there is no software requirement. The conversion will be done by VoltBuilder.
